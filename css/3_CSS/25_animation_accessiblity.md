# CSS Animations and Accessibility Concerns

## What Are CSS Animations, and How Do They Work?

CSS animations allow elements to transition between different states over time. They are defined using the `@keyframes` rule and applied to elements with properties like `animation-name`, `animation-duration`, and `animation-timing-function`.

### Example:

```css
@keyframes fadeIn {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
  }
}

.box {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: blue;
  animation: fadeIn 2s ease-in-out;
}
```

### Key Properties:
- `@keyframes` – Defines the animation steps.
- `animation-name` – Links an element to a keyframe animation.
- `animation-duration` – Specifies how long the animation runs.
- `animation-timing-function` – Controls the acceleration pattern (e.g., `ease-in-out`).
- `animation-iteration-count` – Determines how many times the animation repeats.

## What Are Accessibility Concerns Around Using Animations, and How Can `prefers-reduced-motion` Help?

Animations can cause discomfort for users with motion sensitivity. Fast or unexpected motion can trigger dizziness, nausea, or disorientation. To improve accessibility, the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query allows developers to adjust animations for users who prefer minimal motion.

### Example:

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .box {
    animation: none;
  }
}
```

### Best Practices:
- Avoid excessive motion for essential UI interactions.
- Provide alternatives, like opacity changes instead of movement.
- Use `prefers-reduced-motion` to respect user preferences.

By implementing these techniques, developers can create more inclusive web experiences while maintaining engaging visuals for users who enjoy animations.
