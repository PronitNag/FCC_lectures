# Responsive Web Design (RWD)

## What Is Responsive Web Design?
Responsive Web Design (RWD) is a design approach that ensures web pages adapt to different screen sizes and devices. This is achieved using flexible layouts, media queries, and responsive units like percentages, `em`, and `rem`.

### Relationship to CSS Grid and Flexbox
- **CSS Grid**: A two-dimensional layout system for placing elements in rows and columns.
- **Flexbox**: A one-dimensional layout system used for aligning items in a row or column.
- Both help create flexible, adaptive designs.

### Example:
```css
.container {
  display: flex; /* Using Flexbox */
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
```

## How Do Media Queries Work?
Media queries allow you to apply CSS rules based on device characteristics like screen width, height, and resolution.

### Common Media Types and Features:
- **Media Types**: `screen`, `print`, `all`, `speech`
- **Features**: `max-width`, `min-width`, `orientation`, `aspect-ratio`

### Example:
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  body {
    background-color: lightblue;
  }
}
```

## What Are Media Breakpoints?
Breakpoints define the screen sizes at which a website layout should change to enhance usability.

### Common Breakpoints:
- **Small (Phones)**: `max-width: 576px`
- **Medium (Tablets)**: `min-width: 577px` and `max-width: 768px`
- **Large (Laptops & Desktops)**: `min-width: 769px` and `max-width: 1024px`
- **Extra Large (Large Screens)**: `min-width: 1025px`

### Example:
```css
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  }
}
```

## What Is the Mobile-First Approach?
The **mobile-first approach** means designing for mobile devices first and then progressively enhancing the layout for larger screens using media queries.

### Example:
```css
/* Default styles for mobile */
.container {
  display: block;
}

/* Adjust for larger screens */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .container {
    display: flex;
  }
}
```

This ensures a smooth and optimized experience across all devices.
