# HTML and Its Role on the Web

## What Is HTML?
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create web pages. It structures the content of a webpage using a system of elements (tags) that define different types of content such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more.

### Key Roles of HTML:
- Defines the structure of a webpage.
- Works with CSS and JavaScript to create dynamic and styled pages.
- Uses elements enclosed in angle brackets (`<tag>`).
- Is interpreted by web browsers to display content.

### Example of a Basic HTML Page:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is a simple HTML document.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

# HTML Attributes and Their Role

## What Are Attributes?
Attributes provide additional information about an HTML element. They are always included within the opening tag and usually consist of a name and a value.

### How Attributes Work:
- Modify the behavior of an element.
- Are written inside the opening tag.
- Consist of a key-value pair (e.g., `href="https://example.com"`).

### Common HTML Attributes:
1. `href` - Defines the URL for links.
2. `src` - Specifies the source file for images.
3. `alt` - Provides alternative text for images.
4. `class` - Assigns a class name for styling.
5. `id` - Gives a unique identifier to an element.

### Example of HTML Attributes:
```html
<a href="https://example.com">Visit Example</a>
<img src="image.jpg" alt="A beautiful scenery">
<p class="highlight">This is a highlighted paragraph.</p>
